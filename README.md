# 📱 BLoC for Beginners: Flutter State Management Tutorial

This project demonstrates how to implement **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** pattern in Flutter, using a simple **Counter App**. BLoC is a powerful design pattern that separates the **business logic** from the **UI**, enabling a more modular, testable, and reusable codebase.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is a step-by-step introduction to BLoC, aimed at **beginners** who are looking to learn state management in Flutter using BLoC. It helps developers understand how BLoC works, and how to manage the state of an application efficiently.

## 🚀 Features

- **Counter App** functionality (increment and decrement).
- **BLoC State Management**: Learn how to manage app state using BLoC, which separates the business logic from the presentation layer.
- **Reactive Programming**: Utilize streams to update the UI in response to state changes.
- **Modular Code**: The app is structured to keep business logic and UI separate, improving readability and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A powerful UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **BLoC**: A design pattern that helps to separate business logic from UI components in Flutter applications.
- **Streams**: Used to manage state and provide a reactive programming approach to Flutter apps.
